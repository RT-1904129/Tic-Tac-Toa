# Tic-Tac-Toe
- I worked under the supervision of Dr. Neha Karanjkar, CSE professor from IIT Goa
- I developed a Reinforcement Learning agent from scratch to automate a board game against a human player such as Tic-Tac-Toe. 
- We wrote code in OOP(object oriented  Programming). And we completed  Tic-Tac-Toe . 
- **In this project any two guys can means one is RL-agent and Another is Gamer can play the game And In most of case RL-agent is only win the game**
- Here we have two Policy depends on either RL-agent playing first or not .
