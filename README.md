# Tic-Tac-Toe
- I worked under the supervision of Dr. Neha Karanjkar, CSE professor from IIT Goa .
- I developed a Reinforcement Learning agent from scratch to automate a board game against a human player such as Tic-Tac-Toe. 
- We wrote code in OOP(object oriented  Programming). And we completed  Tic-Tac-Toe . 
- **In this project any two guys can means one is RL-agent and Another is Gamer can play the game And In most of case RL-agent is only win the game**.
- Here we have two Policy depends on either RL-agent playing first or not .
- It is generalized Tic-Tac-Toe we can give any square matrix of any size as in code I given 3X3 you can give any nXn dimentions .
